# X-Team 003 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will discuss with our team members and decide who wants to do which task and ensure that everyone has a task and that every task is assigned to someone.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Have each person confirm with the team that they completed their assigned tasks.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will make sure to inform everyone in the team if we are having difficulties with our task(s). We each have eachothers emails an phone number's so we have two methods of communication.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will have everyone check to ensure that every task was completed before the deadlines. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Make sure to communicate who is working on what, to ensure that two people are not working on the same task without them knowing.
